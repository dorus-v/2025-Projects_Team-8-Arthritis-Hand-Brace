Example: A2 = Asymmetrical, 2 (split) lines

ALL TESTS WERE PERFORMED AT 0.3 bar!


A2: Very inflexible, can only be folded diagonally and barely at all along any other axis.

A3: Easy to fold around the vertical axis, medium resistance around horizontal axis. Feels slightly flimsier than A2.

A4: Similar to A3, slightly easier to fold.

A5: Similar to A4, slightly easier to fold.
